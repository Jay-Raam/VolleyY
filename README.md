## Problems & Solutions
Problem 1: Efficient Product Data Management
Challenge: Managing and displaying a wide array of product data effectively while ensuring fast load times and a responsive shopping experience.

Solution: Utilized server-side rendering with Next.js to fetch and render product data before sending it to the client. Employed MongoDB for efficient data storage and management, coupled with caching mechanisms to minimize load times and enhance performance.

Problem 2: Responsive Design
Challenge: Ensuring the application is fully responsive and delivers a consistent experience across various devices and screen sizes.

Solution: Applied TailwindCSS for a responsive design that adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes. Leveraged Shadcn UI components for a consistent and accessible user interface, integrating flexible grid layouts, media queries, and accessibility best practices.

Problem 3: Real-Time Search and Filtering
Challenge: Implementing a swift search and filtering mechanism to help users quickly find products.

Solution: Developed dynamic search functionality that updates results in real-time as users input search terms. Employed efficient querying techniques with MongoDB to handle search and filtering operations promptly, providing users with immediate feedback.
